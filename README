NagDroid
by Daniel Ramsay

NagDroid is a simple frontend for Nagios, which shows a minimalist view of a
system's status, formatted for a small screen using regular Android widgets.

It's very basic at the moment, but I'm hoping to improve the layout and design
very soon.

The app can be built and installed onto any Android device.  There is a
server-side python script which reformat's Nagios' status.dat file into XML,
which needs to be installed onto the nagios server.  This saves a lot of screen
scraping effort.

NagDroid is licensed under the GPL version 3.
