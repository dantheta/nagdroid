Copy the nagios-xml.cgi file to your nagios cgi-bin directory.

Edit nagios-xml.cgi to contain the correct paths to python (min. version 2.5), and the nagios status.dat file.

Make executable.  You should now be able to view the nagios status as xml at:

http://www.example.com/path/to/nagios/cgi-bin/nagios-xml.cgi

This path should be entered as the Nagios URL in the settings dialog in the Android app.
